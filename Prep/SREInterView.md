SRE iterview focuses on system and OS level understanding along with coding. Knowledge of debugging is essential.

Here is a snippet from FB recruiter about how to prep for SRE,

General Interview Tips  
* Be open about what you know and don’t know. The interview is set up to push you to the limits of your knowledge
and see how you react outside of that, so always attempt to answer the question at hand. The interview is designed 
to be challenging for all candidates.  
* The interviewer will provide hints along the way if you get stuck – don’t be afraid to iterate as you go.  
* Ask clarifying questions whenever necessary.  
* Think through your solutions out loud, and share as much relevant knowledge as possible. 
   
Talking out loud helps the interviewer understand your thought processes. 
 
Linux Internals 

This portion of the Systems interview is designed to evaluate your knowledge of Linux internals and topics can include,
but are not limited to: 

* Process Execution and/or Threads
* Memory Usage
* RAID Levels
*  The kernel and how it interacts with other system components
*   System Calls
*   Signals and Signal Handlers
*  Modern Web Architectures and Webservers
*  SWAP Space   
 
Tips to help you prepare for Linux Internals  

* No one tool or topic is critical, but a broad familiarity with each of these spaces and the ability to  
apply that knowledge to new situations is important. That being said, having both depth and breadth  
will only impress your interviewers more.  
* Everything from the kernel to the user space is fair game, and we look for both breadth and depth of 
knowledge.
* Review userspace / Kernel space boundaries and interactions.  
  Examples might include: ioctls, sysctls, context switches.
 
Troubleshooting:  

The Engineer will lay out a system related issue or problem that you are seeing in the infrastructure and   
ask you to troubleshoot it. As you take each step, the Engineer will provide the hypothetical system  
output to prompt you to the next step. Here is an example exchange:  
 
Interviewer: 'You're seeing this in the infrastructure. How would you troubleshoot it?'  
Interviewee: 'I'd check this first'  
Interviewer: 'OK, you get this in response. What next?'  
Interviewee: 'I'd run this command next'  
 
A second scenario might involve having you analyze Linux / Unix system performance using various tools. The engineer will
share a copy of a report via coderpad.io and the expectation would be for you to identify what the potential issues might be and your approach for resolving them. While this is a less common scenario, please be sure to have access to a computer / internet connection
during the interview. 
 
Tips to help you prepare for Troubleshooting:  

* We’re looking for a structured, methodical approach. Narrow down potential issues systematically  
   as you zero in on the root cause.
* Review troubleshooting tools for system-level performance issues and for debugging 
   application-level performance issues or bugs.
*  Be sure to have access to a computer / internet connection during the interview.
