# Baffle:
Things I didn't do well:  
  * Keep answers short and pointed
  * Didn't ask too claryfying question: Example. when asked give me an example of how would you go about fixing and debugging a problem. 
    Clarification: Ask for an scenario. Even if you pick a scenario, say it out. DIDN't DO that.
   * Prepare specfic questions for the team. 
   
  Questions to prepare for:
   1. If you say GO, then have some sample code
   2. Polish up on cloud debgging. Provide an example debug issues. 
   3. When describing project. Make sure you highlight the portions you implemented, you executed, and nuggets that you brought on.
